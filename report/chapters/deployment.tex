        April 2023 & ongoing & County MEDIC stopped dispatching CFD on additional calls, leading to noticeable shifts across most EMS calls, effective from April 21, 2023. \\
        \midrule
        March 2020 & ongoing & Changes in population dynamics and locations have occurred, such as the relocation of an uptown homeless camp to hotels in South and West Charlotte during COVID-19. This has led to shifts in call locations and population characteristics, particularly income, in affected areas. Affordable low-income areas are moving further from the city center, while formerly affordable neighborhoods are being replaced by luxury residential developments, resulting in different types and volumes of calls. These changes may add complexity to the analysis of geospatial call trends. \\
